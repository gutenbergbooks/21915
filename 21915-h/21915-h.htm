<h2><span class="gesp">DIRECTIONS</span></h2>

<h4><span class="gesp">FOR</span></h4>

<h4>Navigating on Part of the South Coast of <span class="gesp"><i>NEWFOUNDLAND</i>.</span></h4>

<hr style="width: 50%;" />

<p class="cen">N.B. <i>All Bearings and Courses hereafter-mentioned, are the true
Bearings and Courses, and not by Compass.</i></p>

<br />

<p><span class="sidenote">Cape Chapeaurouge.</span>

Cape <i>Chapeaurouge</i>, or the Mountain of the <i>Red Hat</i>, is situated on
the West side of <i>Placentia Bay</i>, in the Latitude of 46&deg; 53' North,
and lies nearly West 17 or 18 Leagues from Cape St. <i>Maries</i>; it is
the highest and most remarkable Land on that Part of the Coast,
appearing above the rest something like the Crown of a Hat, and may be
seen in clear Weather 12 Leagues.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Harbours of St. Laurence</span>

Close to the Eastward of Cape <i>Chapeaurouge</i> are the Harbours of
<i>Great</i> and <i>Little St. Laurence</i>. To sail into <i>Great St. Lawrence</i>,
which is the Westermost, there is no Danger but what lies very near
the Shore; taking Care with Westerly, and particularly S.W. Winds, not
to come too near the <i>Hat Mountain</i>, to avoid the Flerrys and Eddy
Winds under the high Land. The Course in is first N.W. till you open
the upper Part of the Harbour, then N.N.W. half W. The best Place for
great Ships to Anchor, and the best Ground is before a Cove on the
East-side of the Harbour in 13 Fathom Water. A little above <i>Blue
Beach Point</i>, which is the first Point on the West-side; here you lie
only two Points open: You may Anchor any where between this Point and
the Point of <i>Low Beach</i>, on the same Side near the Head of the
Harbour, observing that close to the West Shore, the Ground is not so
good as on the other Side. Fishing Vessels lay at the Head of the
Harbour above the Beach, sheltered from all Winds.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>To sail into <i>Little St. Laurence</i> you must keep the West Shore on
Board, in order to avoid a sunken Rock which lies a little without the
Point of the <i>Peninsula</i>, which stretches off from the East-side of
the Harbour: You Anchor above this <i>Peninsula</i>, (which covers you from
the Sea Winds) in 3 and 4 Fathom Water, a fine sandy Bottom. In these
Harbours are good Fishing Conveniencies, and plenty of Wood and Water.
Ships may Anchor without the <i>Peninsula</i> in 12 Fathom good Ground, but
open to the S.S.E. Winds.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sauker Head.</span>

<i>Sauker-Head</i> lies 3 Miles to the Eastward of Cape <i>Chapeaurouge</i>, it
is a pretty high round Point, off which lie some sunken Rocks, about a
Cable's Length from the Shore.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Garden Bank</span>

This Bank whereon is from 7 to 17 Fathom Water, lies about half a Mile
off from <i>Little St. Laurence</i>, with <i>Blue Beach Point</i> on with the
East Point of <i>Great St. Laurence</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Ferryland Head.</span>

<i>Ferryland head</i> lies S.W. 1 Mile from Cape <i>Chapeaurouge</i>, it is a
high rocky Island, just seperated from the Main; it and Cape
<i>Chapeaurouge</i> are sufficient Marks to know the Harbours of St.
<i>Laurence</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Bay of Laun.</span>

West 5 Miles from <i>Ferryland-Head</i>, lies the Bay of <i>Laun</i>, in the
Bottom of which are two small Inlets, called <i>Great</i> and <i>Little
Laun</i>. <i>Little Laun</i>, which is the Eastermost, lies open to the S.W.
Winds, which generally prevails upon this Coast, and therefore no
Place to Anchor in. <i>Great Laun</i> lies in about N. by E. 2 Miles, is
near half a Mile wide, whereon is from 14 to 3 Fathom Water. To sail
into it, you must be careful to avoid a sunken Rock, which lies about
a quarter of a Mile off from the East Point. The best Place to Anchor
is on the East-side, about half a Mile from the Head, in 6 and 5
Fathom; the Bottom is pretty good, and you are shelter'd from all
Winds, except S. and S. by W. which blow right in, and cause a great
swell. At the Head of this Place is a Bar Harbour, into which Boats
can go at half Tide; and Conveniences for a Fishery, and plenty of
Wood and Water.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Laun Islands.</span>

Off the West Point of <i>Laun Bay</i> lay the Islands of the same Name, not
far from the Shore; the Westermost and outermost of which lie W.
Southerly 10 Miles from <i>Ferryland-head</i>; near a quarter of a Mile to
the Southward of this Island is a Rock whereon the Sea breaks in very
bad Weather: There are other sunken Rocks about these Islands, but
they are no ways Dangerous, being very near the Shore.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Taylor's Bay.</span>

This Bay which lies open to the Sea, lies 3 Miles to the Westward of
<i>Laun</i> Islands; off the East Point are some sunken Rocks near a
quarter of a Mile from the Shore.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Point Aux Gaul.</span>

A little to the Westward of <i>Taylors Bay</i> there stretches out a low
Point of Land, called <i>Point Aux Gaul</i>; off which lies a Rock above
Water, half a Mile <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>from the Shore, called <i>Gaul Shag Rock</i>; this Rock
lies West three quarters South 5 Leagues from <i>Ferryland-Head</i>, you
have 14 Fathom close to the off Side of it, but between it and the
Point are some sunken Rocks.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Lamelin Bay.</span>

From <i>Point Aux Gaul Shag Rock</i>, to the Islands of <i>Lamelin</i> is West
three quarters N. 1 League, between them is the Bay of <i>Lamelin</i>,
wherein is very shallow Water, and several small Islands, and Rocks
both above and under Water, and in the Bottom of it is a Salmon River.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Lamelin Islands.</span>

The two Islands of <i>Lamelin</i> (which are but low) lie off the West
Point of the Bay of the same Name, and lie West three quarters South,
6 Leagues from the Mountain of the <i>Red Hat</i>; but in steering along
Shore make a W. by S. Course good, will carry you clear of all Danger.
Small Vessels may Anchor in the Road between these Islands in 4 and 5
Fathom, tolerably well shelter'd from the Weather: Nearly in the
Middle of the Passage going in between the two Islands, is a sunken
Rock, which you avoid by keeping nearer to one Side than the other,
the most Room is on the East-side. The Eastermost Island communicates
with the Main at Low-water, by a narrow Beach, over which Boats can go
at High-water, into the N.W. Arm of <i>Lamelin Bay</i>, where they lay in
safety. Here are Conveniences for a Fishery, but little or no Wood of
any Sort. Near to the South Point of the Westermost Island is a Rock
pretty high above Water, called <i>Lamelin Shag Rock</i>; in going into the
Road between the Islands, you leave this Rock on your Larboard Side.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Lamelin Ledges.</span>

These Ledges lay along the Shore, between <i>Lamelin Islands</i> and <i>Point
May</i>, which is 3 Leagues, and are very Dangerous, some of them being 3
Miles from the Land. To avoid these Ledges in the Day-time, you must
not bring the Islands of <i>Lamelin</i> to the Southward of East, until
<i>Point May</i>, or the Western extremity of the Land bear N. by E. from
you; you may then steer to the Northward with safety, between <i>Point
May</i> and <i>Green Island</i>. In the Night, or foggy Weather, you ought to
be very careful not to approach these Ledges within 30 Fathom Water,
least you get intangled amongst them. Between them and the Main are
various Soundings from 16 to 5 Fathom.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Observations.</span>

All the Land about Cape <i>Chapeaurouge</i> and <i>Laun</i>, is high and hilly
close to the Sea; from <i>Laun Islands</i> to <i>Lamelin</i> it is of a moderate
Height; from <i>Lamelin</i> to <i>Point May</i>, the Land near the Shore is very
low, with sandy Beaches, but a little way inland are Mountains.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Island of St. Peter's.</span>

The Island of St. <i>Peter</i>'s lies in the Latitude 46 Degrees 46 Minutes
North. West by South near 12 Leagues from Cape <i>Chapeaurouge</i>, and
West by South half South 5 Leagues from the Islands of <i>Lamelin</i>; it
is about 5 Leagues in circuit, and pretty high, with a craggy, broken,
uneven Surface. Coming from the Westward, as soon as you raise
<i>Gallantry Head</i>, which is the South Point of the Island, it will make
in a round Hommock like a small Island and appears if seperated from
St. <i>Peter</i>'s. On the East-side of the Island, a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>little to the N.E.
of <i>Gallentry-Head</i> lay three small Islands, the innermost of which is
the largest, called <i>Dog-Island</i>; within this Island is the Road and
Harbour of St. <i>Peter</i>'s; the Harbour is but small, and hath in it
from 12 to 20 Feet Water; but there is a Bar across the Entrance,
whereon there is but 6 Feet at Low-water, and 12 or 14 Feet at
High-water. The Road which lies on the N.W. Side of <i>Dog-Island</i> will
admit Ships of any Burthen, but it is only fit for the Summer Season,
being open to the N.E. Winds; you may lay in 8, 10, and 12 Fathom, and
for the most Part is a hard rocky Bottom, there is very little clear
Ground; Ships of War commonly Buoy their Cables; the best Ground is
near the North Shore. Going in or out, you must not rainge too near
the East-side of <i>Boar-Island</i>, which is the Eastermost of the three
Islands above-mentioned, for fear of some sunken Rocks which lie East
about 1 Mile from it, and which is the only Danger about St.
<i>Peter</i>'s, but what lay very near the Shore.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Island of Columbo.</span>

This Island is of a small circuit, but pretty high, and lies very near
the N.E. Point of St. <i>Peter</i>'s; between them is a very good Passage,
one-third of a Mile wide, wherein is 12 Fathom Water. On the
North-side of the Island is a Rock pretty high above Water, called
<i>Little Columbo</i>; and about a quarter of a Mile N.E. from this Rock is
a sunken Rock, whereon is 2 Fathom Water.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Island of Langley.</span>

The Island of <i>Langley</i>, which lies on the N.W. Side of St. <i>Peter</i>'s,
is about 8 Leagues in Circuit, of a moderate and pretty equal height,
except the N. end, wich is a low Point with Sand Hills along it; it is
flat a little way off the low Land on both Sides of it, but all the
high Part of the Island is very bold too, and the Passage between it
and St. <i>Peter</i>'s (which is 1 League broad) is clear of Danger. You
may Anchor on the N.E. Side of the Island, a little to the Southward
of the <i>Sand Hills</i>, in 5 and 6 Fathom, a fine sandy Bottom, sheltered
from the Southerly, S.W. and N.W. Winds.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Island of Miquelon.</span>

From the North Point of <i>Langley</i>, to the South Point of <i>Miquelon</i> is
about 1 Mile; it is said that a few Years since they join'd together
at this Place by a Neck of Sand, which the Sea has wash'd away and
made a Channel, wherein is 2 Fathom Water. The Island of <i>Miquelon</i> is
4 Leagues in Length from North to South, but of an unequal Breadth;
the Middle of the Island is high Land, called the high Land of <i>Dunn</i>;
but down by the Shore it is low, except Cape <i>Miquelon</i>, which is a
lofty Promontory at the Northern extremity of the Island.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dunn Harbour.</span>

On the S.E. Side of the Island, to the Southward of the high Land, is
a pretty large Bar-Harbour, called <i>Dunn Harbour</i>, which will admit
Fishing Shallops at half Flood, but can never be of any Utility for a
Fishery.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Miquelon Rocks and Bank.</span>

<i>Miquelon Rocks</i> stretches off from the East Point of the Island,
under the high Land 1 Mile and a quarter to the Eastward, some are
above and some under Water; the outermost of these Rocks are above
Water, and you have 12 Fathom close to them, and 18 and 20 Fathom 1
Mile off. N.E. half N. 4 or 5 Miles from these Rocks lie <i>Miquelon
Bank</i> whereon is 6 Fathom Water.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Road of Miquelon.</span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>The Road of <i>Miquelon</i> (which is large and spacious) lies at the
North-end, and on the East-side of the Island, between Cape <i>Miquelon</i>
and a very remarkable round Mountain near the Shore, called
<i>Chapeaux</i>: Off the South Point of the Road are some sunken Rocks,
about a quarter of a Mile from the Shore, but every where else it is
clear of Danger. The best Anchorage is near the Bottom of the Road in
6 and 7 Fathom, fine sandy Bottom; you lay open to the Easterly Winds,
which Winds seldom blow in the Summer.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cape Miquelon.</span>

Cape <i>Miquelon</i>, or the Northern extremity of the Island is high bluff
Land; and when you are 4 or 5 Leagues to the Eastward or Westward of
it, you would take it for an Island, by reason the Land at the Bottom
of the Road is very low.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Seal Rocks</span>

The <i>Seal Rocks</i> are two Rocks above Water, lying 1 League and a half
off from the Middle of the West-side of the Island <i>Miquelon</i>; the
Passage between them and the Island is very safe, and you have 14 or
15 Fathom within a Cable's Length all round them.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Green Island.</span>

This Island which is about three-quarters of a Mile in Circuit, and
low, lies N.E. 5 Miles from St. <i>Peter</i>'s, and nearly in the Middle of
the Channel, between it and <i>Point May</i> on <i>Newfoundland</i>; on the
South-side of this Island are some Rocks both above and under Water,
extending themselves 1 Mile and a quarter to the S.W.</p>

<br />
<br />

<h3><i>Description of</i> Fortune Bay.</h3>

<p><i>Fortune Bay</i> is very large, the Entrance is form'd by <i>Point May</i> and
<i>Pass Island</i>, which are 12 Leagues N. by E. and S. by W. from each
other, and it is about 23 Leagues deep, wherein are a great many Bays,
Harbours, and Islands.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Island of Brunet.</span>

The Island of <i>Brunet</i> is situated nearly in the Middle of the
Entrance into <i>Fortune Bay</i>, it is about 5 Leagues in Circuit, and of
a tolerable Height; the East-end appears at some Points of view like
Islands, by reason it is very low and narrow in two Places. On the
N.E. Side of the Island is a Bay, wherein is tolerable good Anchorage
for Ships in 14 and 16 Fathom, shelter'd from Southerly and Westerly
Winds; you must not run too far in for fear of some sunken Rocks in
the Bottom of it, a quarter of a Mile from the Shore; opposite this
Bay on the South-side of the Island, is a small Cove, wherein small
Vessels and Shallops can lay pretty secure from the Weather, in 6
Fathom Water; in the Middle of the Cove is a Rock above Water, and a
Channel on each Side of it. The Islands laying at the West-end of
<i>Brunet</i>, called <i>Little Brunets</i>, afford indifferent Shelter for
Shallops in blowing Weather; you may approach these Islands, and the
Island of <i>Brunet</i>, within a quarter of a Mile all round, there being
no Danger but what lay very near the Shore.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Plate Islands</span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><i>Plate Islands</i> are three Rocks of a moderate Height, lying S.W. 1
League from the West-end of <i>Great Brunet</i>. The Southermost and
outermost of these Rocks, lay W. by S. half S. 11 Miles from Cape
<i>Miquelon</i>, and in a direct Line between <i>Point May</i> and <i>Pass
Island</i>, 17 Miles from the former and 19 from the later; S.E. a
quarter of a Mile from the <i>Great Plate</i> (which is the Northermost) is
a sunken Rock, whereon the Sea breaks, which it the only Danger about
them.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Observations</span>

There are several strong and irregular Settings of the Tides or
Currents about the <i>Plate</i> and <i>Brunet Islands</i>, which seem to have no
dependency on the Moon, and the Course of the Tides on the Coast.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Island of Sagona.</span>

The Island of <i>Sagona</i>, which lies N.N.E. 2 Leagues from the East-end
of <i>Brunet</i>, is about 3 Miles and a half in circuit, of a moderate
Height, and bold too all round, at the S.W. end is a small Creek that
will admit Fishing Shallops; in the Middle of the Entrance is a sunken
Rock which makes it exceeding narrow, and difficult to get in or out,
except in fine Weather.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Point May.</span>

<i>Point May</i> is the Southern Extremity of <i>Fortune Bay</i>, and the S.W.
Extremity of this Part of <i>Newfoundland</i>; it may be known by a great
black Rock, nearly joining to the Pitch of the Point, and something
higher than the Land, which makes it look like a black Hommock on the
Point; near a quarter of a Mile right off from the Point, or this
round black Rock, are three sunken Rocks, whereon the Sea always
breaks.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dantzic Coves.</span>

Near 2 Miles North from <i>Point May</i>, is <i>Little Dantzic Cove</i>, and
half a Leag. from <i>Little Dantzic</i> is <i>Great Dantzic Cove</i>; these
Coves are no Places of safety, being open to the Westerly Winds; the
Land about them is of a moderate Height, bold too, and clear of Wood.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fortune.</span>

From <i>Dantzic Point</i> (which is the North Point of the Coves) to
<i>Fortune</i> the Course is N.E. near 3 Leagues; the Land between them
near the Shore is of a moderate Height, and bold too; you will have in
most Places 10 and 12 Fathom two Cables Length from the Shore, 30 and
40 one Mile off, and 70 and 80 two Miles off. <i>Fortune</i> lies North
from the East-end of <i>Brunet</i>, it is a Bar Place that will admit
Fishing Boats at a quarter Flood; and a Fishing Village situated in
the Bottom of a small Bay, wherein is Anchorage for Shipping in 6, 8,
10, and 12 Fathom; the Ground is none of the best, and you lay open to
near half the Compass.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Grand Bank.</span>Cape of <i>Grand Bank</i> is a pretty high Point, lying 1 League N.E. from
<i>Fortune</i>; into the E. ward of the Cape is <i>Ship Cove</i>, wherein is
good Anchorage for Shipping, in 8 and 10 Fathom, shelter'd from
Southerly, Westerly, and N.W. Winds. <i>Grand Bank</i> lies E.S.E. half a
League from the Cape, it is a Fishing Village, and a Bar Harbour, that
will admit Fishing Shallops at a quarter Flood; to this Place and
<i>Fortune</i> resort the Crews of Fishing Ships, who lay <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>their Ships up
in Harbour <i>Briton</i>. From the Cape of <i>Grand Bank</i> to Point <i>Enragee</i>,
the Course is NE. a quarter E. 8 Leagues, forming a Bay between them,
in which the Shore is low with several sandy Beaches, behind which are
Bar Harbours that will admit Boats on the Tide of Flood, the largest
of which is <i>Great Garnish</i>, <span class="sidenote">Great Garnish.</span> 5 Leagues from <i>Grand Bank</i>, it may be
known by several Rocks above Water laying before it, 2 Miles from the
Shore, the outmost of these Rocks are steep too, but between them and
the Shore are dangerous sunken Rocks. To the Eastward, and within
these Rocks is <i>Frenchman's Cove</i>, <span class="sidenote">Frenchman's Cove.</span> wherein you may Anchor with small
Vessels, in 4 and 5 Fathom Water, tolerably well shelter'd from the
Sea Winds, and seems a convenient Place for the Cod Fishery: The
Passage in is to the Eastward of the Rocks that are the highest above
Water; between them and some other lower Rocks laying off to the
Eastward from the East Point of the <i>Cove</i>, <span class="sidenote">Anchorage.</span> there is a sunken Rock
nearly in the Middle of this Passage, which you must be aware of. You
may Anchor any where under the Shore, between <i>Grand Bank</i> and <i>Great
Garnish</i> in 8 and 10 Fathom Water, but you are only shelter'd from the
Land Winds.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Point Enragee.</span>

<i>Point Enragee</i> is but low, but a little way in the Country is high
Land; this Point may be known by two Hommocks upon it close to the
Shore, but you must be very near, otherwise the Elevation of the high
Lands will hinder you from discovering them; close to the Point is a
Rock under Water.</p>

<p>From <i>Point Enragee</i> to the Head of the Bay, the Course is first N.E.
a quarter E. 3 Leagues to <i>Grand Jervey</i>; then N.E. by E. half E. 7
Leagues and a half to the Head of the Bay; the Land in general along
the South-side is high, bold too, and of an uneven Height, with Hills
and Vallies of various extent; the Vallies for the most Part cloathed
with Wood, and water'd with small Rivulets.</p>

of <i>L'Argent</i>; before this Harbour and the Bay <i>L'Argent</i> is a
remarkable Rock, that at a Distance appears like a Shallop under Sail.
<i>Harbour Millee</i> branches into two Arms, one laying into the N.E. and
the other towards the E. at the upper Part of both is good Anchorage,
and various Sorts of Wood. Between this Harbour and <i>Point Enragee</i>,
are several Bar Harbours in small Bays, wherein are sandy Beaches, off
which Vessels may Anchor, but they must be very near the Shore to be
in a moderate Depth of Water.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cape Millee.</span>

<i>Cape Millee</i> lies N.N.E. half E. 1 League from the afore-mentioned
<i>Shallop Rock</i>, and near 3 Leagues from the Head of <i>Fortune Bay</i> is a
high reddish barren Rock. The wedth of <i>Fortune Bay</i> at <i>Cape Millee</i>
doth not exceed half a League, but immediately below it, it is twice
as wide, by which this Cape may be easily known; above this Cape the
Land on both Sides is high, with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>steep craggy Cliffs. The Head of the
Bay is terminated by a low Beach, behind which is a large Pond or Bar
Harbour, into which Boats can go at quarter Flood. In this and all the
Bar Harbours between it and <i>Grand Bank</i>, are convenient Places for
building of Stages, and good Beaches for drying of Fish, for great
Numbers of Boats.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Grand L'Pierre Harbour</span>

<i>Grand L'Pierre</i> is a good Harbour, situated on the North-side of the
Bay, half a League from the Head, you can see no Entrance until you

before which are two Islands, one without the other; the outermost,
which is the largest is of a tolerable Height, and lies in a Line with
the Coast, and is not easy to be distinguished from the Main in
sailing along the Shore. To sail into this Harbour, the best Passage
is on the West-side of the outer Island, and between the two; as soon
as you begin to open the Harbour, you must keep the inner Island close
on Board, in order to avoid some sunken Rocks that lay near a small
Island, which you will discover between the NE. Point of the outer
Island, and the opposite Point on the Main; and likewise another Rock
under Water, which lays higher up on the Side of the Main; this Rock
appears at Low Water. As soon as you are above these Dangers, you may

<p><span class="sidenote">Cannaigre Head.</span>

<i>Cannaigre Head</i> which forms the East Point of the Bay of the same
Name, lies North Easterly 3 Leagues and a half from the West-end of
<i>Brunet</i>; it is a high craggy Point, easy to be distinguished from any
Point of view. From this Head to <i>Basstarre</i> Point, the Course is W.
by N. half N. 2 Leagues, and likewise W. by N. half N. 3 Leagues and a
half to the Rocks of <i>Pass Island</i>; but to give them a Birth make a W.
by N. Course good. <span class="sidenote">Cannaigre Bay.</span>Between <i>Cannaigre Head</i> and <i>Basstarre Point</i> is

of the same Name above Water, you may approach these Rocks very near,
there being no Danger but what discovers itself. The Channel between
them and the North Shore is something Dangerous, by reason of a range
of Rocks which lie along Shore, and extend themselves 1 Mile off.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cannaigre Harbour.</span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span><i>Cannaigre Harbour</i> which is very small, with 7 Fathom Water in it, is

are two Islands of a tolerable Height, on the South-side of the
Westermost Island, which is the largest, are some Rocks above Water.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dawson's Cove.</span>

This Cove is on the N.W. Side of the Bay, bears North, Distance about
4 Miles from the Head, and East 2 Miles from the W. end of the <i>Great

Vessels in 6 and 5 Fathom Water, but they will lay open to the
Southerly Winds. Between the S.W. Point of this Cove and <i>Basstarre
Point</i>, which is 5 Miles Distance, lays the Range of Rocks
beforementioned.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Basstarre Point.</span>

<i>Basstarre Point</i> which forms the West Point of <i>Cannaigre Bay</i>, is of

<i>Pass-Island</i>, which bears N.W. by W. 1 League from <i>Basstarre Point</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Observations.</span>

The Land on the North-side of <i>Fortune Bay</i> for the most Part is
hilly, rising directly from the Sea, with craggy, barren Hills, which
extends 4 or 5 Leag. Inland, with a great Number of Rivulets and
Ponds. The Land on the South side of <i>Fortune Bay</i>, has a different
Appearance to that on the North-side, being not so full of craggy
Mountains, and better cloathed with Woods, which are of a short brushy
kind, which makes the face of the Country look green.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Pass Island.</span>

<i>Pass Island</i> lies N. 16&deg; 30' East 7 Leagues and a half from <i>Cape
Miquelon</i>, it is the N.W. extremity of <i>Fortune Bay</i>, and lies very
near the Shore, is more than 2 Miles in circuit and is pretty high. On
the S.W. Side are several Rocks above Water, which extend themselves 1
Mile from the Island, and on the N.W. Side is a sunken Rock at a
quarter of a Mile from the Island; the Passage between this Island and
the Main, which is near two Cables Length wide, is very safe for small
Vessels, wherein you may Anchor in 6 Fathom, a fine sandy Bottom. This
Island is well situated for the Cod Fishery, there being very good
Fishing Ground about it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">On the Soundings.</span>

In the Night time, or in foggy Weather, Ships ought to place no great
Dependance on the Soundings in <i>Fortune Bay</i>, least they may be
deceived thereby, for you have more Water in many Parts near the
Shore, and in several of its contained Bays and Harbours, than in the
middle of the Bay itself.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span><i>Great Jervis Harbour</i> is situated at the West Entrance into the Bay
of <i>Despair</i> is a snug and safe Harbour, with good Anchorage in every
Part of it, in 16, 18 or 20 Fathom, though but small will contain a
great Number of Shipping, securely sheltered from all Winds, and very
convenient for wooding and watering. There is a Passage into this
Harbour on either Side of <i>Great Jervis Island</i>, the southermost is
the safest, there being in it no Danger but the Shore itself. To sail
in on the North-side of the Island, you must keep in the middle of the
Passage, until you are within two small Rocks above Water near to each
other on your Starboard-side, a little within the North Point of the
Passage; you must then bring the said North Point between these Rocks,
and steer into the Harbour, in that Directions will carry you clear of
some sunken Rocks which lie off the West Point of the Island; these
Rocks appear at Low-water. The Entrance into this Harbour may be known
by the East-end of <i>Great Jervis Island</i>, which is a high steep craggy
Point, called <i>Great Jervis Head</i>, and is the North Point of the South
Entrance into the Harbour.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">North Bay.</span>

This is an Arm of the Bay of <i>Despair</i>, which extends to the Northward
5 Leagues from <i>Great Jervis Island</i>. In this Bay is very deep Water,
and no Anchorage but in the small Bays and Coves which are on each
Side of it. At the Head of the Bay of the East, which is an Arm of the
North Bay, is a very fine Salmon River, and plenty of various Sorts of
Wood.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Eagle Island.</span>

To the Northward of <i>Long Island</i>, the Bay of <i>Despair</i> extends itself
to the NE. about 8 Leagues, whereon are several Arms and Islands. The
first is <i>Eagle Island</i> laying on the North-side of <i>Long Island</i>,
about half a Cable's Length from the Shore; a little to the Eastward
of it is a small Cove, wherein small Vessels can Anchor in 5 Fathom
Water; off the E. Point of this Cove are some sunken Rocks, the
outermost of which lay a quarter of a Mile from the Shore, and appears
at half Ebb.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Frenchman's Harbour.</span>

This harbour lies on the North-side of <i>Long Island</i>, 2 Miles above
<i>Eagle Island</i>, in and before which Vessels may anchor in various
Depths of Water; about a Cable's length to the Eastward of the West
Point of the Harbour is a sunken Rock whereon is 8 Feet Water; a
little way further to the Eastward is a small Island not far from the
Shore, near to which is a Rock that just Covers at high Water.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Isle Bois.</span>

On the North-side of the Bay, opposite to <i>Long Island</i>, lies the
<i>Isle Bois</i>, it is near 3 Leagues in Length, and of a tolerable
Height; the Passage on the North-side of it (called <i>Lampadois</i>
Passage) is very safe, but very deep Water.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fox Island.</span>

This Island lies nearly in the middle of the Bay, between the East-end
of the Isle of <i>Bois</i> and <i>Long Island</i>, it is of a round Form, pretty
high, and bold too all round.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Isle Riches.</span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>The <i>Isle Riches</i> lies off the East-end of the Isle of <i>Bois</i>, it is
about a Mile in Circuit, and pretty high; on the East-side of it are
some small Islands, and some sunken Rocks quite a-cross from the
Island to the Main, so that in sailing up the Bay of <i>Despair</i>, you
must leave this Island on your Starboard-side.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Little River.</span>

This is an Arm of the Bay laying in to the Eastward from the Isle of
<i>Riches</i>, it is very narrow, and counted a good Place for a Salmon
Fishery; its Banks are stored with various Sorts of Wood.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Bay Rotte.</span>

This is a small Bay which lays North from the East-end of the Isle of
<i>Bois</i>, in which are some sunken Rocks near the Head.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Bay of Conne.</span>

From the Isle of <i>Riches</i> the Bay extends itself to the Northward
about five Miles, commonly called the Bay or River of <i>Conne</i>, then
branches into two Arms, one still tending to the North, and the other
to the Eastward; the Water is very shallow for some Distance from the
Head of both. About these Arms, and the Bay of <i>Conne</i>, are great
Plenty of all Sorts of Wood, common to this Country, such as Firr,
Pine, Birch, Witch-Hasle, Spruce, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Observations.</span>

All the Country about the Entrance into the Bay of <i>Despair</i>, and for
a good Way up it is very mountainous and barren, but about the Head of
the Bay it appears to be pretty level, and well cloathed with Wood.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">On the Tides.</span>

Between St. <i>Laurence</i> and Point <i>May</i>, an ESE. Moon makes high Water
at the Islands of St. <i>Peters</i> and <i>Miquelon</i>, and in all Parts of
<i>Fortune Bay</i> a S.E. Moon makes High Water. In the Bay of <i>Despair</i> a
SE. by S. Moon makes High Water; in all which Places it flows up and
down, or upon a perpendicular Spring Tides 7 or 8 Feet; but it must be
observed that they are every where greatly governed by the Winds and
Weather.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Currents.</span>

The Currents on the Sea Coasts from Cape <i>Chapeaurouge</i> towards St.
<i>Peter's</i>, sets generally to the SW. On the South-side of <i>Fortune
Bay</i> it sets to the Eastward, and on the North-side to the Westward.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Winds.</span>

The South West, and Westerly Winds generally blow in the Day during
the Summer, and about the Evening they die away; and in the Night you
